# What this is.
This single file Java code is written to visualize the path of a projectile in the command-line interface (CLI). It demonstrates how physics equations can be translated into parabolic formulas, making it possible to represent the trajectory of a 2D projectile visually on a text editor.

The inspiration is from my Analytical Geometry with Calculus lessons and Physics 1 lessons from FEU-Tech.

## How to run:
- First is to copy the whole code [here](https://github.com/marhosa/Projectile-Visualizer-in-Java-Console/blob/main/src/Main.java).
- Then you can try it out by pasting it on [this website](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler). But make sure to full screen the CLI so it runs properly.

#### Tweaks:
- In line 56 and 57 of [the code](https://github.com/marhosa/Projectile-Visualizer-in-Java-Console/blob/main/src/Main.java), you can change its resolution.
- If the code won't run, try removing line 1 "package Main;".
